# Bookmarx ![alt text](https://www.browncross.com/bookmarx/images/black-star.png "Bookmarx")

#### Version 2.3

A personal bookmark tracker written in [Clojure](https//clojure.org) and [ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript). It is essentially a rewrite, sans gold-plating, of the excellent [Bookmark4U](http://bookmark4u.sourceforge.net) which I used for many years, and whose interface and source code have unfortunately become pretty dated. Kudos to the authors of this application.

On the front-end it is using [Reagent](https://reagent-project.github.io/), which is a ClojureScript wrapper for the [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) user interface framework. The user interface style is the ubiquitous [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) framework. On the back-end it is using [Redis](https://redis.io/) for persistence.

This was written for my own edification, so the features are completely due to my whim. I put this project on Github so that others could use this as an example of a Clojure/Script application. Enjoy!

* The icons in this application are from [Gylphicons](http://glyphicons.com) which are part of the Bootstrap framework.
